= SULChrome

The SUL Chrome gem provides some basic styles for a rails app under the Stanford University Libraries visual design.  This is based on a Sasified version of Twitter Bootstrap (https://github.com/vwall/compass-twitter-bootstrap).

The mixins that are defined by by the SUL Chrome gem are abstracted out into their own file, which is then included into the base_css.  You can use the mixins provided by importing the mixins file into your css:
@import "sul_chrome/sul_chrome_mixins";

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
